Coming up with some ideas for frameworks. Going to go through existing frameworks
past and present for inspiration. Then going to sketch up some API ideas (non-functioning).
After getting some good concepts and decent feeling APIs then to make proof of
concepts with non-optimized functional framework...

## some frameworks to draw inspiration from

* Angular.js 1.x - I don't trust it after 1.x
* Backbone.js - I know it had it's problems, but there are still some good ideas there
* Vue.js - the new hotness, some cool ideas
* React.js - the current big hitter from FB, not very framework like though
* Ember.js - as a whole I'm not a big fan but there are some good ideas

## libraries worth a look at

* babel.js - modern JS transpiling, why not?
* React.js - everyone is doing it. Might not be a lot to borrow here, if you want
to do things the react way may as well use react.
* RX.js - modern day observables
* redux.js - immutable state management with pure functions, actions up - data down.
* immutable.js - pure functions and immutable data, good for predictable state changes.
* polymer.js - Web components-ish

...More notes to come
